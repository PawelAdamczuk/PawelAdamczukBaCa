These are snippets of code created by me during my programming learning process. You are free to reuse the code, 
however, these functions are very poorly documented, they have been tested only against several sample inputs, 
and bugs are very likely to show up if you decide to reuse this code. If you are looking for solid implementations 
of these algorithms to use in your project, I strongly advise against using this particular repository. However, 
if you still decide to go with it, all you can find in here is licensed under the MIT licence.

I am aware of the poor code quality, lackluster documentation, lack of any project structures and bad programming practices 
that this code exhibits. However, the aim of this repo isn't providing high quality, reusable code. Those were mere 
exercises and they fulfilled their goal. I am not going to work on improving this code's quality.

If you are looking for some background on why this code was created, most of files here were answers to programming 
and algorythmic exercises I did as part of the Computer Science course that I started in 2014 on Jagiellonian University, 
Cracow. They were automatically tested in a code testing system called BaCa.
